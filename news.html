      <h2>Organic farming in a tight spot as policy support stalls</h2>
      <p>On 11 March 2025 the government closed the Sustainable Farming Incentive without warning. The scheme had been helping farmers switch to organic and other green methods. The sudden closure left many growers in England without the payments they were counting on, and the number of new organic applications dropped sharply.</p>
      <h3>Demand is still rising</h3>
      <p>Even with the policy setback, people are buying more organic food than ever. The Soil Association reports that sales reached a record £3.7 billion in 2024, up 7.3 % on the previous year. Supermarkets, farm shops and veg‑box schemes all saw growth, and Generation Z shoppers are leading the way.</p>
      <h3>Import rules are changing</h3>
      <p>From 1 February 2027 the UK will require certificates of inspection for organic goods arriving from the EU, EEA and Switzerland. This means importers will need to make sure their suppliers can provide the right paperwork, which may add to the cost of bringing organic food into the country.</p>
      <h3>Scotland and Wales take a different line</h3>
      <p>While England has pulled its support, the devolved nations are moving in the other direction. Scotland increased its organic farmland by 13 % in 2024 thanks to supportive policies, and Wales has announced a new Sustainable Farming Scheme starting in 2026 with ongoing support for organic farms.</p>
      <h3>Home supply is lagging</h3>
      <p>Only 3 % of UK farmland is organic, so the country still relies on imports to meet demand. Defra’s latest figures show that organic land grew by just 1 % in 2024, and the number of certified organic operators fell slightly. Bridging this gap between demand and supply is one of the biggest challenges facing the sector.</p>
      <h3>Dairy shows signs of recovery</h3>
      <p>The organic dairy sector is starting to improve after a difficult period. Organic milk deliveries have grown by nearly 14 % since December 2024, even though the number of organic cows has fallen. This suggests that farms are getting more milk from fewer animals.</p>
      <h3>The sector comes together</h3>
      <p>Events like the Organic Growers Gathering help build community among producers. Growers meet to share skills and ideas, and to support each other through tough times. These gatherings show the strength of the organic network across the UK.</p>
      <h3>Why our directory matters</h3>
      <p>With demand growing and policy in flux, our directory plays an important role. It connects customers to farmers, box schemes and shops, making it easier to support organic producers. If there isn’t a farm near you, use the search to find a delivery scheme. Every purchase helps keep organic farming alive in the UK.</p>
